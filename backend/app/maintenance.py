"""Fresh-start reset.

With `reset_on_start` enabled the backend truncates every scan artefact at
startup, so a restart begins from a clean slate instead of carrying the
previous run's jobs, findings and captured traffic forward.

What is deliberately NOT wiped by default:

  engagements   The authorization scope. Losing it means the next scan has no
                record of what you were allowed to test, and submit()'s scope
                gate would reject everything anyway.
  audit_log     The trail of what was run against whom. On an authorized
                engagement this is the evidence that you stayed in scope; it
                should outlive a container restart.
  settings      Runtime settings saved from the UI (API keys included), which
                are re-applied on boot by settings_store.

Both exclusions have their own flag for when you really do want everything
gone. Truncation happens after init_db() so the tables are guaranteed to
exist, and TRUNCATE ... CASCADE handles the foreign keys between them.
